## Overview
American Sign Language is a complete language made up of hand symbols and gestures that is used by the majority of North Americans who are deaf or hard of hearing. Digit is a recognition system that provides accurate real-time identification of these symbols and gestures through the use of machine learning models.

This recognition system has several potential uses that could increase the level of communication between those who are deaf or hard of hearing and those who are not. For example, Digit could be used to implement educational applications or real-time translation and transcription of sign language.

Digit was developed by:

* Colleen Kovar

* Mashour Rahman

* Zak Barbezat

* Jacob Versaggi

* Wei Li

* Raymond Yung

in the fall, winter, and spring quarters of 2019-2020 as a senior design project for the school of Computing and Infomatics at Drexel University
